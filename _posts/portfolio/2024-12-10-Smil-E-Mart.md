The game draws inspiration from those odd grocery store moments we’ve all had, spotting bizarre item combinations and wondering, who buys this stuff? and why? But this isn’t just a quirky simulator. It’s set in a world where survival and secrecy go hand in hand, and as a robotic cashier, your role extends beyond mundane transactions.

**Synopsis:**\
Step into the shoes of a robotic cashier in a post-apocalyptic future. The rebels are planning to start a war. In this simulation, you’ll do more than just scan groceries, you’ll unravel the mysteries behind your customers’ lives through their peculiar purchasing habits and cryptic behaviors.

At the start, you are programmed for basic tasks, unable to fully grasp the semantics of human interaction. That changes when a mysterious customer hands you a special chip. This upgrade allows you to decipher their words and introduces a unique communication system based on emojis.

With each interaction, you’ll learn more about the customers and the crumbling society they navigate. You have the ability to flag suspicious customers, making decisions that impact the story’s progression. Every choice matters, leading to diverse endings that reflect your actions and judgment.
