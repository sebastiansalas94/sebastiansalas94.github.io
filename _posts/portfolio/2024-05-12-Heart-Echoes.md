Heart Echoes is a Role Playing Game where you will build meaningful relationships with the townsfolk using the construction of bridges as a metaphor.

This project was design and developed as a proposal for the College of Arts, Media and Design of Northeastern University as a one of the winner for the Art+Design Project Grant. This videogame is still in development phase!

**Synopsis:**\
You've just arrived in a new place. Unfamiliar, maybe even a little strange. But it's also a chance to build meaningful connections with the people around you. The culture is different, and at first, it might feel like you're on the outside. Still, every person in the town has a story to share. Youâ€™ll get to know them through a thoughtful puzzle minigame: a conversation where you build a bridge between you and them.

    </div>

The puzzle's progression in the conversation is by turns. One turn the player, one turn them. In each turn, the player will initiate the conversation by talking or engaging in certain behavior. Then, they will see if they liked what you did and react accordingly. If they liked it they will build the bridge with you, if they don't, they will try to destrot it. After that, they will keep giving some new prompt for the player to continue the conversation.

Between the player and them there is a tilemap with empty tiles. The player needs to fill this gap in effort with thm to connect and build a relationship.

We encourage our players to reflect on elements such as what makes us human while navigating the rigid communication system of a robot where emojis are all they can use to talk. When self-agency and ability are stripped away from oneself, is there anything else left within us that differentiates us from being a robot? All these are key themes we baked into our game design, hoping to bring our players a comprehensive experience that is emotional and insightful.
