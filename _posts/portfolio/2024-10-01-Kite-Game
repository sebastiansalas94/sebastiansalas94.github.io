Inspired by the work "El Pandero" by Alfonso Quijano from the museum's collection, seeing some children playing with their kite trapped in a tree and how this represents the problem they have in their lives, we want all people to fly their kite facing obstacles and fulfilling their dreams. 

The visual and artistic part was inspired by the works "Avenida" by Leon Ferrari and "Serie Amazonica: Selva#2" by Maria Thereza Negreiros as they are works in constant movement with different shapes and colors without forms, respectively. With one last surprise, taken from the work "Teatro Belalcázar". 

I worked as a game designer and software developer creating the concepts and the mechanics of the game. From the creation of the concept of controlling the character and the kite, the physics of the kite and how it should behave and the obstacles that the player should surpass.
