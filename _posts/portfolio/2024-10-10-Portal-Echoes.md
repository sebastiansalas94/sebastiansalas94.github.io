This was a task for a Game Development Course where we were required to implement a new weapon for the character. I decided to go for a weapon whose mechanics were more support-oriented and could also provide a playful experience depending on its usage while solving puzzles.

**Genre:** Puzzles\
**Software:** Unreal Engine 4\
**Project Type:** Solo Project\
**Development Time:** 2 Week\
**My Role:** Lead Programmer


Replicating this mechanic allowed me to understand the code structure, the design patterns and the architecture of the original implementation, giving me insights on how to solve a problem that other experienced developers had to deal with from a very successfulÂ game.
This project was made for the course *Videogame Development in Unreal Engine* .

**My Responsabilities:**
* Implemented the character movement and the Portal Gun mechanics.
* Level Design and Puzzles.
* Developed enemy's AI to patrol and detect the player when they enter its vision field..
* Maintain and Debug the code in C++ and Blueprints.
