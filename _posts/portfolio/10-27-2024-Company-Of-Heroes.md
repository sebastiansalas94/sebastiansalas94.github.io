**Synopsis:**
**Company of Heroes gameplay** focuses on controlling squads with various units in it and giving them commands to perform actions. The player should control these units to traverse the map to seize the objectives and claim the Point of Interests while managing resources to deploy new squads as needed.

In our board game adaptation for Company of Heroes the gameplay is similar. The player controls squads moving toward the objectives through a grid map with fog of war, where at any time an enemy unit can appear while traversing the map.
