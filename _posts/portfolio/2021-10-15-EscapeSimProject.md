**Escape Simulation Project** was a personal project where I explored different implementations of mechanics as a software developer in Unreal Engine. 
The game consists on finding 4 reactors to open the door and escape to win.

This reactors are in different zones where each one has its own obstacles. One of the explored mechanics was traps and there were 2 kinds. 
The first one is a barrel that if you are too close to it when it explodes it will leave you in a burned state, this was an experimentation of a status ailment that does damage over time. 
The other one is a mine that if you step on it explodes, but it can be destroyed shooting at it.

There was also an enemy patrolling a designated space in the map that when it detected the player would begin a persecution . With each kill the player does it would fill the XP Bar to unleash an ultimate when it's fully charged. This ultimate has the ability to slow time and let the player to move at a high speed.
