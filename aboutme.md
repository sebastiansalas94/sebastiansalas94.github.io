My name is Sebastian Salas and Iâ€™m Technical Game Designer and Game Developer pursuing a Master's in Game Science and Design with a Bachelor's in Software Engineering. 

I have technical abilities in Unity (C#), Unreal Engine (C++) and Blueprints.


### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
