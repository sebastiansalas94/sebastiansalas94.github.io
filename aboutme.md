subtitle: Technical Game Designer and Game Developer
---

My name is Sebastian Salas, and I’m a Technical Game Designer and Game Developer with a Bachelor’s in Software Engineering, currently pursuing a Master’s in Game Science and Design at Northeastern University. I’m passionate about creating games that bring diverse stories to life and feature engaging, mechanically rich gameplay.

With 7 years of experience as a Software Engineer, I have a strong technical background in Unity (C#), Unreal Engine (C++), and Blueprints, as well as expertise in Python, .NET, NodeJS, and Azure Cloud Computing. Most recently, I worked with Electronic Arts (EA) to develop components for the EA App, the successor to Origin.

Originally from Barranquilla, Colombia, I’m now based in Boston, MA.
